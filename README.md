### Step 7.:- After generating the gcode format then follow the these instruction as shown in below figure.
###   1.	Switch on the 3d printer.
###   2.	Place your Pen drive in USB.
###   3.	Clean the surface bed plate.
###   4.	Load filament into the required extruder as per the requirement.
###   5.	Wait until the nozzle & bed plate comes into the required temperature.
###   6.	Close the doors of the 3d printer.
###   7.	Open the file from the USB storage and select the Print option.
